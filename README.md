# File Structure

We use Atomic Design to properly organize our files in a hierarchial structure.
The idea is for these components to be highly reusable.
Atoms are the smallest components. Next are molecules and then organisms.

# CSS Techniques

We use a Fluid style layout using Flexbox. This way spacings are consistent
throughout the screen changes.

# Suggestions

- Use X logo instead of Twitter
- More figma designs for other screen sizes

# Steps Taken

There is a framework on how I work when making pages.
I start taking a screenshot and identifying what are the big and medium components.
This helps me identify which are reusable or not.
