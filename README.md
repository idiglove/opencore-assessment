# File Structure

We use Atomic Design to properly organize our files in a hierarchial structure.
The idea is for these components to be highly reusable.
Atoms are the smallest components. Next are molecules and then organisms.

# CSS Techniques

We use a Fluid style layout using Flexbox. This way spacings are consistent
throughout the screen changes.

# Suggestions

- Use X logo instead of Twitter
- More figma designs for other screen sizes
- A consistent design system, especially for fonts

# Steps Taken

How long it took me? 7 hours

## What was my process?
There is a framework on how I work when making pages.
I start taking a screenshot and identifying what are the big and medium components.
This helps me identify which are reusable or not.

I used some components from ShadCDN to build the UI, along with Tailwind it made it easy
to customize them.

I start my work with desktop first, as it's easier to modify and test. Once I'm done with desktop and functionalities, I go to mobile to modify styles.

## Gotchas I saw :))

- On mobile the image grid has a gradient background, nice challenge to test eye for details!
- The badges can be pills below the cards
